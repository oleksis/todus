Use the ToDus API (**login/download/upload**) in your Python projects.

üì¶ The package is adapted for [use in Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/oleksis/todus/blob/todus3/docs/todus3.ipynb) üìì

## Install

To install run:
```bash
  pip install todus3
```

If want support for upload by parts using 7Zip (py7zr):
```bash
  pip install todus3[7z]
```

## Usage
```bash
### Help
todus3 -- help

### Login and Enter PIN
todus3 -n 53123456 login

### Download from TXT files with 3 Workers/Threads
todus3 -n 53123456 download -t 3 file.txt [file.txt ...]

### Upload file by parts in Bytes (10 MB)
todus3 -n 53123456 upload binary.bin -p 10485760
```

## Configuration

When using `todus3` the configuration file (.ini) is created with the `DEFAULT` section and the following keys with values:

```
[DEFAULT]
max_retry = 3  # Maximum number of times to repeat if an error occurs
down_timeout = 30.0  # Maximum time in seconds to reach time out
production = True
password = PASSWORD  # Password established when sending the registration code
token = TOKEN  # Token that is used in the authentication for uploading or downloading files
```

## ‚ö† Advice

The following is recommended for uploading or downloading the file:

If your speed (download/upload) is equal to 70 KB/s in 120 seconds (ToDus limit) you can upload up to approximately 8 MB

* P (Part of the file in MB)
* Vd (Average download speed in KB/s)

```
P = Vd * 120 / 1024
```

## Developmet 
For execute app in development mode you need install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or use [Docker](## Docker)
Install dependencies 
```shell
poetry config virtualenvs.create false && poetry install --no-interaction --no-ansi
```
